# Design Principles

## 1. Minimalism and Focus
- Main content (joke) displayed in screen center without unnecessary frames
- Clear typography (headlineMedium for main content)
- Clean spacing that allows content to "breathe"

## 2. Visual Hierarchy
- Primary content centered
- Version navigation below content
- Secondary actions at bottom
- Clear separation between content areas

## 3. Smart Interaction
- Common actions (like rating) accessible with one tap
- More complex options hidden in modal/menu
- Intuitive icons with short labels
- Long press for additional options

## 4. Visual Feedback
- Interactive buttons with clear press states
- Meaningful colors (red for deletion)
- Subtle transitions (fade for modals)
- Clear indication of current state

## 5. Consistency
- Uniform spacing (16px base)
- Consistent icon sizes (28px)
- Coherent typography (Paper's variant system)
- Predictable interaction patterns

## 6. Accessibility
- Comfortable tap targets
- Good text-background contrast
- Clear labels for all actions
- Meaningful icon labels

## 7. Material Design Integration
